## Description

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

### Hint 1

Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

## Solution

- The goal of this challenge is to learn about the basics of Hexadecimal encoding standards. I invite you to read the resources I linked down below if you're not familiar with them yet.

- The solution to this challenge is fairly simple, you only need to either look through a HEX to decimal conversion table or use online tools to convert the character `0x3D` to decimal.

PS: You can ignore the `0x` at the start of the character since it's a prefix to indicate that the character is in hexadecimal rather than in some other base.

- Once you convert the character, just wrap it between a `picoCTF{_}` to respect the flag notation convention.
