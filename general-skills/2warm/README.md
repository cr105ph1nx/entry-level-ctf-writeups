## Description

Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

### Hint 1

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

## Solution

- The goal of this challenge is to learn about the basics of decimal and binary numeral systems. I invite you to read the resources I linked down below if you're not familiar with them yet.

- The solution to this challenge is fairly simple, you only need to either look through a decimal to binary conversion table or use online tools to convert the number `42` in base10 to base2.

- Once you convert the character, just wrap it between a `picoCTF{_}` to respect the flag notation convention.
